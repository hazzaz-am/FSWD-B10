							‘Genocide must be prosecuted, the killers will not be

							Regarding the student-public movement, leaders of the Democracy
							Platform have stated that every bullet must be accounted for, the
							perpetrators of the genocide must be brought to justice, and those
							responsible for the killings should not be allowed to lead the
							investigation. They called for the formation of a special tribunal
							to ensure justice. These statements were made by the platform
							leaders during a press conference organized by the Democracy
							Platform at the central office of Citizen Unity on Wednesday. The
							Democracy Platform leaders held the press conference following
							their visit to Rangpur and Bogura, where they paid tribute to the
							martyr Abu Saeed at his grave, and met with his family, activists,
							and local people. The leaders emphasized the need to create a
							complete list of the martyrs and the injured, provide advanced
							medical treatment to the injured, and offer financial and
							necessary support to the families of the deceased and injured.
							They called for the return of Sheikh Hasina, the principal accused
							in cases of genocide, enforced disappearances, murders, looting,
							money laundering, and election fraud, to the country, where she
							and her accomplices should be tried. They also highlighted that
							Abu Saeed is a beacon of light whose sacrifice inspired people to
							overcome fear. The leaders noted that millions of students and
							members of the public across the country have become more vocal in
							their protests, accelerating the movement and forcing the
							invincible autocrat to flee. The government's primary
							responsibility at this moment, they asserted, is to compile a list
							of these brave soldiers who have contributed to freeing the
							country from fascism. The leaders further demanded the
							establishment of a special tribunal to try those involved in the
							July genocide, from Sheikh Hasina down to her accomplices and
							members of the various forces who participated in the massacre.
							The families of the martyrs must be taken care of, and the injured
							must receive proper medical treatment either within the country or
							abroad without delay. Additionally, the assets of business groups
							and families involved in bank fraud, corruption, and embezzlement
							must be confiscated in favor of the state, and the laundered money
							must be recovered. The Democracy Platform leaders also stressed
							that the main spirit of the uprising is to reform the current
							fascist, autocratic state centered around one individual and to
							establish an accountable, just, and equitable state and society.
							To achieve this goal, the interim government must initiate
							discussions on state reforms with representatives from the
							political parties, civil society, and all sections of society. The
							press conference was attended by Mahmudur Rahman Manna, President
							of Citizen Unity; Saiful Haque, General Secretary of the
							Revolutionary Workers Party; Zonayed Saki, Chief Coordinator of
							the People's Solidarity Movement; Sheikh Rafiqul Islam Bablu,
							Convener of the Followers of Bhashani Council; Md. Siraj Mia,
							Senior Vice-President of the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD); and
							Imran Iman, Organizational Coordinator of the State Reform
							Movement.
